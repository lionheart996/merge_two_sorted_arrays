Title: Merge Sorted Linked Lists

Description:

This Python script merges two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list using a dummy node. It iteratively compares nodes from both lists, appending the smaller node to the merged list, and continues until all nodes are processed. Designed for educational purposes, it demonstrates efficient linked list manipulation in Python.
